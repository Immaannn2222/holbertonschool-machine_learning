## General description

This repository sums up up my academic journey learning about machine learning and AI.
It contains 4 main sub-repositories which are:

### Math : "Algebra and Calculus"`,

A collection of courses of calculus,  probability and statistics needed for machine learning algorithms development and their integration using python.

### Supervised Learning,

Supervised learning is where you have 'input' variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
Multuple projects building a general knowledge and deep practice of main subjects such as RNNs, classification, natural language processing, object detection...

### Unsupervised learning,

The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data.

### Reinforcment Learning,

Starting off with the Deep Q-learning algorithm... Description will be updated


## Built With

- Python3

**Bold** Libraries

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib
- numpy
- csv

## Future Updates

- [ ] Working on the reinforcment learning
